## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**My cards keep failing to generate. Why?**

This could be because,
- Your OpenAI API Key has expired.
- You ran out of OpenAI API credits.
- Your prompt is misconfigured. Remember that {sentence} and {word} should both be in lowercase. It's case sensitive. There should be no other {x} in your prompt.

**The audio did not generate. Why?**

If you're using VoiceVox or AivisSpeech, you must ensure you have it running in the background.

If you're using ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS then sure you have an internet connection.

**Why cards fail to generate in bulk after a few cards. Why?**

If you recently made an OpenAI Developer account then your rate limit will be low for the first few days. I'd recommend waiting a few days and only generating a few cards at a time.
